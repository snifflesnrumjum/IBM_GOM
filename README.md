Individual-based model for the western Gulf of Mexico

This model is designed to simulate phytoplankton (specifically dinoflagellates in its current form) in the water column. 
It is fully three dimensional but relies on a model domain created from multiple input sources including: Gulf of Mexico HYCOM (https://hycom.org) and MODIS PAR data (http://oceandata.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov).
